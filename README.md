# Clustering_for_EastWest_Airlines
Perform clustering (Hierarchical, K-Means, and DBSCAN) for the airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters. Draw the inferences from the clusters obtained.
The file East West Airlines contains information on passengers who belong to an airlineâ€™s frequent flier program. For each passenger the data include information on their mileage history and on different ways they accrued or spent miles in the last year. The goal is to try to identify clusters of passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers

As this problem comes under Unsupervised Type of Machine Learning where there is 'NO' specific output i.e. NO 'y'
Clustering analysis is an unsupervised learning method that separates the data points into several specific bunches or groups, such that the data points in the same groups have similar properties and data points in different groups have different properties in some sense.

It comprises of many different methods based on different distance measures. E.g. K-Means (distance between points), Affinity propagation (graph distance), Mean-shift (distance between points), DBSCAN (distance between nearest points), Gaussian mixtures (Mahalanobis distance to centers), Spectral clustering (graph distance), etc.

Centrally, all clustering methods use the same approach i.e. first we calculate similarities and then we use it to cluster the data points into groups or batches. Here we will focus on the Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method.
